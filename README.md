## FAQ:

### Can I use different images for the speed dials?
Yes! Just right-click the speed dial and select Edit.

### One of my site thumbnails disappeared?
SSD loads thumbnails using the Open Graph standard. This keeps those thumbnails up to date automatically, but if a website removes the image it may no longer load in SSD. To fetch new images, simply right-click the dial and select "Refresh thumbnails".

### Why does SSD require the "access your data for all websites" permission?
This is required for SSD to capture an image of the website for the thumbnail. **SSD accesses absolutely no other data for any reason whatsoever**. These two features (visual thumbnails and user privacy) were the primary motivation for creating SSD. Note, SSD still works if you deny this permission, just without capturing thumbnails.

### Why is SSD showing CPU usage in the Chrome task manager?
While the actual CPU usage is very low (confirm using your OS task manager), some cycles are used to elimate jankiness. SSD uses a high performance rendering engine (GSAP) to keep user ineractions and animations smooth. The usage is 0 when SSD is not in focus.

### Can I open speed dial links in Firefox Containers?
Yes, just use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right-click</kbd> on the speed dial to access the default context menu.

### Why isn't the address bar focused (active) by default on the new tab / home page?
This is a bug in Firefox. You can nag Mozilla to fix it here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1411209
